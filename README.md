<h1 align="center"> Hi there fellow developer ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
I'm a junior Software Developer who is passionate about contributing to open source projects. Here you'll find a variety of repositories showcasing my programming skills and projects I've worked on. As a fan of open source hardware, I also enjoy building keyboards and have built a few open source keyboards. Take a look around and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities!

&nbsp;

Also I am the owner of the AllrounderClan. AllrounderClan is a Discord server where we play games, chat, and have fun. We also have a Minecraft server that's always up and running, so you can join us anytime. It's a great place to hang out and meet new friends, whether you're a hardcore gamer or just looking for a casual chat. Come join us and be part of our community!
